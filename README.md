# Mental-health-in-tech-workspace  In this project we are determining how technology impact our mental health like social comparison, feelings of missing out, and cyberbullying all stem from the content we see online. These negative impacts lead to more depression and anxiety. Our bodies experience the negative effects of technology, too. More screen time can disrupt sleep, especially if this screen time is before bed. We were motivated by the Connecting Communities theme to create a project that addresses a subject of importance to college students throughout the world who are studying in technology and seeking employment in the IT sector. The treatment of mental health issues in the tech workplace is much more challenging because most people are reluctant to talk about their issues. We want to raise as much awareness as we can about this important subject and give new employees confidence that there is someone who will listen to their difficulties and offer support.
